A survey has an ID, a title, and one or more questions.

- There are several types of multiple choice question: traditional multiple choice questions
(where exactly one answer must be selected), multiple choice questions where any number
of answers may be selected, and multiple choice questions where exactly k answers must be
selected (k must not be greater than the number of answer options).

- Any multiple choice question has answer options, and there are always at least two.

- In addition to multiple choice questions there are numeric and timetable questions,

- A numeric question requires an integer answer; we won't handle quoats. A numeric question
may have a lower and/or upper bound on acceptable response values.
- Timetable questions have one or more timeslots associated with them (each described by text
such as "Monday evenings" or \Dec 1st, 2-3pm"). For each one, the user will indicate their
availability. A timetable question can offer the user two choices (indicating that they are
available or not available) or these plus a third option that is in-between.
- Every question has a question ID and question text.
- Each question is either mandatory (users are required to answer these) or optional.
