- A numeric question requires an integer answer; we won't handle quoats. A numeric question
may have a lower and/or upper bound on acceptable response values.
- Timetable questions have one or more timeslots associated with them (each described by text
such as "Monday evenings" or \Dec 1st, 2-3pm"). For each one, the user will indicate their
availability. A timetable question can offer the user two choices (indicating that they are
available or not available) or these plus a third option that is in-between.
- Each question is either mandatory (users are required to answer these) or optional.
